ISEL, ano lectivo 1516, semestre verão, PI, turma 51N

This is a personal repository with my samples, tests and other stuff that i consider important for my class of PI (Programação na Internet / Internet Programming ) at ISEL.

It is not intendend to be used as a project or a final product and it will show my learning process.

Feel free to use at your own risk.
